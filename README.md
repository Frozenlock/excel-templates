# Excel Templates

Excel templates is designed to build Excel spreadsheets by combining two parts:

1. A Excel file that works as a template defining layout and formatting information for the spreadsheet you're creating
2. A Clojure data in the form of maps and seqs that defines the contents to be inserted in the resulting spreadsheet.

## Why Use Excel Templates?

The spreadsheet is the preferred tool for data presentation and exploration for many users, especially in business.

Presenting data in Excel is much more compelling than sending out, for example, a Comma-Separated-Value (CSV) file. This is especially true when you add some simple formatting to accentuate structure and meaning in the data, for example by formatting numbers as dollars or percentages or by grouping together columns of related information.

## Using Excel Templates

When you use an excel template, sheets are handled row-by-row.

If data is supplied for the row, it replaces the data that was already in that row, except for nils which use the data or formula from the corresponding cell in the template. All cells use the format specified in the template sheet.

When multiple rows of data are supplied for a single row in the template, the template row is expanded into the target sheet. Each resulting row in the target has the formatting of the original template row.

If there's no data supplied for the row, the row is copied exactly (both data and formatting) from the template to the output workbook.

### Building your template

You build a template just like you'd build a regular Excel spreadsheet, but you can fill it with dummy data.

Use excel formatting commands to format cells, rows, and columns as you would like them. This includes number formatting, alignment, shading, etc. Add explanatory graphics (like text boxes, etc.) to communicate the results most clearly.

Save this template to a regular xlsx file from Excel. `excel-template` will look for templates by path name or in resources, so it's possible to include templates in you jar file by adding it to resources.

### Building the data

In your Clojure program, just create a plain old map as follows:

```clojure
{ Sheet-Name-1 { actions-for-that-sheet }
  Sheet-Name-1 { actions-for-that-sheet }
  ... }
```

Each set of actions is itself a map:

```clojure
{ row-num-1 [[replacement row 1]
             [replacement row 2]
              ... ]
  row-num-2 [[replacement row 1]
             ... ]}
```

For example, we can use the following:

```clojure
{"Squares" {3 [[1 1]
               [2 4]
               [3 9]]}}
```

To replace the second row of the spreadsheet with 3 rows each with a number and its square.

If "Squares" is the only worksheet in the template, we could simply
use the inner map:

```clojure
{3 [[1 1]
    [2 4]
    [3 9]]}
```

I show the data as vectors above, but it can actually be any seq.

### Generating a spreadsheet

To generate a new spreadsheet from code, use the `build-with-template` function, passing in three arguments:

1. The name of the input template workbook file or resource.
2. The name of the output workbook to create
3. The data to inject into the workbook.

Here is the code to create the workbook of squares discussed above:

```clojure
(require '[excel-templates.build :as excel])

(excel/build-with-template
   "squares-template.xlsx"
   "squares.xslx"
   {"Squares" {3 [[1 1]
                 [2 4]
                 [3 9]]}})
```
